MusicScoring
======

This is a private repository for the research project I'm working on for my master's thesis. The code generates a difficulty/complexity measurement for a piece of music written in music xml. The paper will eventually be a software research paper to be submitted to conference.

In the current version, the default settings are to output a difficulty score for level1.xml (including in the repo) based on the beginner difficulty setting. To change the piece of music, specify the full path to an alternate xml file as a command line parameter. To change the difficulty setting, specify a number 1-5 inclusive representing the difficulty (1 is lowest, 5 is highest) as a command line parameter. Both of these can be changed simultaneously and can appear in any order as command line parameters.

The beginner difficulty setting is mostly hardcoded into the system, but will eventually be read in from an xml file. At the moment no other difficulty settings are in place, so changing the difficulty will do nothing. This feature will be implemented later, but the user functionality is already present. Changing the file should work however.

This version traces difficulty by allocating difficulty points for each note and interval. Each note and interval (usually specified by ranges of notes/intervals) is assigned a specific score, typically an integer between 1 and 10. Whenever that note/interval is encountered, that score is multiplied by some additional components and then added to the running tally of scores. At the end, the overall score is output. The additional components that make up the multipliers are the speed/tempo (notes/minute), the dynamic level (ppppp-fffff), the articulations (regular, staccato, tenuto, slurred, accented, or strongly accented), and the key signature (7 flats-7 sharps). Each of these are similarly assigned a specific score, typically between 0.5 and 2. Except for speed/tempo, each of these are applied immediately at the time a note/interval is encountered. The speed/tempo multiplier is applied at the end when the total notes and total time have been counted, for simplicity.
